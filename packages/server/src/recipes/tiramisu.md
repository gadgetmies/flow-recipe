# Simplified Tiramisu (using ready-made ingredients)

Ingredients
* 1 pack of ladyfingers (savoiardi)
* 2 cups strong coffee or espresso, cooled
* 250 g mascarpone (ready-to-use, from any brand)
* 2 dl whipped cream (or pre-whipped cream substitute)
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
* Cocoa powder for dusting

Steps
1. Mix the cream base: 
  * Combine mascarpone, sugar, and vanilla in a bowl. Dispense whipped cream from the siphon and fold it in until smooth. No electric mixer needed—spoon or spatula is fine.
1. Prepare the coffee dip:
  * Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. You can add a splash of amaretto or rum if you want, but not required.
1. Assemble
  * Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee (1–2 seconds each side). Lay a full layer in a square dish. Spread half of the cream mixture on top. Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the rest of the cream.
1. Finish and chill
  * Dust the surface evenly with cocoa powder. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (overnight is better).
